# Python Hangman Game

This is a classic hangman game developed in Python. The game will randomly choose a word from a text file and you have to guess it letter by letter. You have a limited number of attempts before you lose the game.

## How to play

The game will display the word as a series of underscores, representing each letter. You have to enter a letter that you think is in the word. If the letter is correct, the game will reveal its position in the word. If the letter is wrong, the game will draw a part of the hangman on the gallows.

The game will end when you either guess the word correctly or run out of attempts. The game will show you the number of remaining attempts and the letters you have already guessed.

## Installation

To run this game, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

To run the game, you can use any Python IDE or the command line. For example, if you have the source code in a folder called `src`, you can run this command:

python src/hangman.py

This will launch the game and you can start playing.
